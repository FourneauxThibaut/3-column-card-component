## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS variable
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most i learned was about SEO and good practice about somes attribut.
for exemple: 


```html
<a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontend Mentor</a>
```
> i had no idea i needed to use `rel="noopener"` to keep a `target="_blank"` link secure !

### Useful resources
